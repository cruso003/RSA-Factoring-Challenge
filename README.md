**RSA Factoring Challenge**

#Language - Python

#OS - Standard Ubuntu 20.04 LTS/

#Project Description
We have sniffed an unsecured network and found numbers that are used to encrypt very important documents. It seems that those numbers are not always generated using large enough prime numbers. Your goal of this project is to factorize these numbers as fast as possible before the target fixes this bug on their server - so that we can decode the encrypted documents.
